Description: add support to non-standard buttons on mouse in Linux
 Many mice have side or "thumb" buttons that see limited use in Linux,
 as well as a wheel that is not used by many older applications.
 .
 IMWheel supports these non-standard buttons and/or wheel operations
 by allowing the user to map their input to specific key combinations
 depending on the application in use.
