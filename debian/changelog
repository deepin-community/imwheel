imwheel (1.0.0pre12-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * QA upload.
  * Migrations:
      - debian/copyright to 1.0 format.
      - debian/rules to new (reduced) format.
  * Using new DH level format. Consequently:
      - debian/compat: removed.
      - debian/control: changed from 'debhelper' to 'debhelper-compat' in
        Build-Depends field and bumped level to 13.
  * debian/clean: created to remove a file generated from the build process and
    forgotten by distclean.
  * debian/control:
      - Added 'Rules-Requires-Root: no' to source stanza.
      - Added Vcs-* fields.
      - Bumped Standards-Version to 4.6.0.
      - Removed no longer needed build dependencies dpkg-dev and quilt.
  * debian/imwheel.install: renamed to install.
  * debian/imwheel.prerm:
      - Renamed to prerm.
      - Explicitly add 'set -e'.
  * debian/NEWS: removed all asterisks, as asked by lintian.
  * debian/patches/:
      - Added a numeric prefix to all patch names.
      - build-system-update: dropped. This patch was created in 2010 (revision
        1.0.0pre12-9) to update the autotools files. However, currently, the
        dh_autoreconf do it automatically. Also, this patch will generate a
        FTBFS with DH 13.
      - 070_fix-spelling-errors.patch: created to fix some spelling errors in
        final binary and in manpage.
      - 080_fix-FTCBFS.patch: created to fix a FTCBFS because upstream's
        configure.in uses AC_CHECK_FILE to check for source files. Thanks to
        Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>. (Closes: #901986)
  * debian/salsa-ci.yml: added to provide CI tests for Salsa.
  * debian/tests/control: created to provide a superficial CI test.
  * debian/upstream/metadata: created.
  * debian/watch: created.

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Orphaning the package.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Oct 2014 15:53:50 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert mistaken punctuation changes in the last upload made to
    /etc/X11/Xsession.d/60imwheel_start-imwheel and
    /etc/X11/imwheel/startup.conf (except that 60imwheel_start-imwheel
    will still kill already-running instances of imwheel by default
    when launching). (Closes: #763850)

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Fri, 03 Oct 2014 09:20:30 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove needless quotes around variables in
    /etc/X11/Xsession.d/60imwheel_start-imwheel and in
    /etc/X11/imwheel/startup.conf. If imwheel stops working after
    upgrading, check startup.conf and remove/adjust extra punctuation.
  * Tweak 60imwheel_start-imwheel so that imwheel kills
    already-running instances of itself by default when it launches.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.9.6, and debhelper compatibility level to 9.
    Adjust the build-deps accordingly.
  * Re-jig debian/rules to enable hardening compile flags, and also clean-up
    the same file to address minor lintian warnings.
  * Don't install long-irrelevant 'extra' binaries in /usr/lib/imwheel
    (e.g. mdump). (Closes: #716176)

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Sep 2014 09:48:27 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump standards-version to 3.8.4, and debhelper compatibility level to 7.
  * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format. Add quilt to build-deps, and
    convert patches to the quilt system, documenting them as per DEP 3.
    Tweak debian/rules to handle quilt patching/unpatching as well.
  * Add (misc:Depends} to debian/control.
  * Drop 12 year old EMACS setup commentary from /usr/share/docs/imwheel.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Feb 2010 09:19:53 -0500

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update standards-version to 3.7.3, and debhelper compatibility level
    to 6. No changes.
  * Move Homepage from the package description to a regular
    debian/control field.
  * Don't ignore distclean errors in debian/rules.
  * Don't ship the BUGS file, as it's out of date. Also drop the README,
    as the manpage is more current and has all of the same information.

  * Change the default button spec for clarity. Since X now considers
    everyone to have a horizontal mouse wheel when numbering buttons, we now
    skip over four buttons before we get to the thumb buttons. Update the
    README.Debian to match, and add a NEWS.Debian entry to explain.
  * Revamp the default imwheelrc and manpage, mainly cleaning up and deleting
    references to deprecated options. Also edit these options out of the
    ouput of 'imwheel -h'.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Jan 2008 19:26:41 -0500

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve the last patch slightly, by once again allowing imwheel to be
    started without the '-b' option. Many people don't use this option
    since they are happy with the default ("4 5 6 7 8 9"), and therefore the
    last upload caused imwheel to fail to start for them. Now the old
    behaviour is restored, though if you do use the '-b' option, you
    still need to add the spaces between the numbers. (Closes: #359685)

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Mar 2006 10:41:24 -0500

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply a patch from Thomas Liebetraut <thomas@tommie-lie.de> that
    allows imwheel to control more than 9 buttons. This requires that
    the button spec format be changed, however. Each button number must
    now be separated by a space (so "0089" becomes "0 0 8 9"). Update
    the documentation to reflect this change. Add a NEWS.Debian to
    explain the changes in more detail. (Closes: #203006)

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Mar 2006 21:11:37 -0500

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tweak the build system so that imwheel doesn't depend on libraries
    that it doesn't actually need. Also remove the xutils build-depend,
    which seems to be unnecessary.
  * Adjust the startup.conf imwheel defaults, to better match the most
    common case when using the new X.Org 6.9 or later.
  * Revamp the README.Debian so that users confused by imwheel breaking
    with X.Org 6.9 have sufficient information on the changes to be able
    to adapt and get imwheel working again.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Jan 2006 11:55:09 -0500

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update my e-mail address.
  * Bump DH_COMPAT to 5. No changes required.
  * Remove maintainer scripts that handled old pre-Sarge upgrade issues.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Nov 2005 12:30:48 -0500

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a prerm script that stops running imwheel processes. (Closes: #321924)
  * Grab minor fixes from CVS.
  * Split xlibs-dev build-dependency into parts.
  * Fix debian/copyright GPL address: point to GPL-2, not the symlink
    to the latest GPL version.
  * Minor packaging updates and cleanups to debian/rules.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@freeshell.org>  Wed, 17 Aug 2005 15:35:42 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upload to force mips to try again; pre12-1 was never installed.
    Still urgency=high since pre12-1 never made Sarge.
  * Improved the readability of the upstream changelog.
  * Minor compilation fixes.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@freeshell.org>  Wed, 29 Sep 2004 10:02:49 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    + Re-implements the -k switch in a secure manner.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@freeshell.org>  Wed,  1 Sep 2004 15:12:44 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre11-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Disabled functionality that allowed a nasty local exploit. Urgency=high
    so that this change makes Sarge. (Closes: #267829)
  * Xsession.d xmodmap startup script moved to the "examples" documentation
    subdirectory.
  * Updated the changelog using DEVELOPMENT.TXT on the upstream homepage.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@freeshell.org>  Wed, 25 Aug 2004 20:29:50 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Fixed infinite loop problem, triggered by Enlightenment under certain
      circumstances.
    + Modified gpm no longer included, but it wasn't built anyway.
  * Slight change to the suggested (commented out) imwheel parameters in
    startup.conf (-b "0067" instead of -b "67"), which should make the button
    names in imwheelrc correspond to their purposes more often.
  * Xsession.d imwheel startup script now properly named.
  * Added an Xsession.d xmodmap script (not installed by default), to ease its
    setup, based on the example in the Xsession manpage.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@freeshell.org>  Tue,  8 Jun 2004 11:15:16 -0400

imwheel (1.0.0pre10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New maintainer. (Closes: #249533)
  * New upstream release:
    + No longer segfaults when using "(null)". (Closes: #232353)
    + Patch to prevent "no ~/.imwheelrc" warning no longer required.
    + Fixes the reporting of window classes from GTK2 apps. This may
      require some users to reconfigure, since apps which had
      worked with "(null)" now need their specific window class.
  * Incorporates FTBFS-fixing patch. Thanks to Sebastian Muszynski.
    (Closes: #229409)
  * Scripts to run IMWheel with X automatically are now in place but disabled
    by default.
  * Many other minor packaging changes and updates.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1.0.

 -- Christopher Martin <chrsmrtn@freeshell.org>  Mon, 31 May 2004 20:44:25 -0400

 -- Amaya Rodrigo Sastre <amaya@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 2004 12:37:27 +0100

imwheel (1.0.0pre3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I'm in such a hurry" release!
    Fix some stupid typo. Thanks to J G Miller <miller@yoyo.ORG> for his
    patience and reporting it (too).

 -- Amaya Rodrigo Sastre <amaya@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Mar 2003 22:19:15 +0200

imwheel (1.0.0pre3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix setup-conf so that gpm works the True Debian Way (tm). I mean, no
    patched gpm daemon et all.

 -- Amaya Rodrigo Sastre <amaya@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Mar 2003 20:51:44 +0100

  * Fixed upstream email address all around.

 -- Amaya Rodrigo Sastre <amaya@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Dec 2001 10:33:12 +0100

imwheel (0.9.9pre5-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/rules: Pass --prefix to configure to avoid it installing into
    /usr/local if imwheel isn't on the build system (closes: #104307).
  * debian/rules: Also use --mandir to force /usr/share/man, and remove
    redundant call to dh_installmanpages (closes: #91178).

  * debian/copyright: Update GPL pointer.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Nov 2001 21:29:58 +0000

imwheel (0.9.9pre5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added rm -f mdetect/mdetect to build process; otherwise, the supplied
    binary wasn't rebuilt, causing problems building the package on
    architectures other than i386. Closes: #71443.
    Also added the mdetect/mice directory to /usr/lib/imwheel.

 -- Tom Lees <tom@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Sep 2000 22:46:35 +0100

imwheel (0.9.9pre5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #36828, #62346). No really major changes,
    except a security fix (buffer overflow exploit), which didn't affect us
    too badly because we never had imwheel setuid anyway.
  * The security exploit mentioned above was fixed in an NMU by
    Wichert Akkerman <wichert@soil.nl>; this is the next official release, so
    Closes: #63720.
  * Added some more stuff to the default imwheelrc:
    - support for gnome-terminal (thanks to danny <danny@spesh.com>,
      Closes: #68683).

 -- Tom Lees <tom@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Aug 2000 20:05:22 +0100
