imwheel (1.0.0pre12-8) unstable; urgency=low

    This upload changes the default IMwheel button-spec (the '-b' option) in
    /etc/X11/imwheel/startup.conf. This was done to make IMWheel's default
    configuration logically match the latest X.Org mouse button numbering
    scheme. If IMWheel is configured to your liking, there is no need to let
    dpkg overwrite your files. If you do proceed with the overwrite, then you
    may want to read the revamped README.Debian to understand how everything
    works.

imwheel (1.0.0pre12-7) unstable; urgency=low

    This upload introduces a patch which allows imwheel to use more than 9
    mouse buttons. The new buttons higher are named ExtBt7, ExtBt8, etc.,
    and can be assigned functions in your imwheelrc file accordingly.
    The old sequence was: Up, Down, Left, Right, Thumb1, Thumb2. Now it is
    Up, Down, Left, Right, Thumb1, Thumb2, ExtBt7, ExtBt8, etc. See the
    updated imwheel manpage for details.

    An important change to note is that the format of the button spec
    command line argument for imwheel has changed. Before, imwheel was
    started with an option like -b "0089". Now you must place spaces
    between the button numbers, like this: -b "0 0 8 9". This allows
    users to tell imwheel to control buttons with numbers higher than 9.

    To accommodate these changes, the default
    /etc/X11/Xsession.d/60imwheel_start-imwheel and
    /etc/X11/imwheel/startup.conf files shipped with the imwheel package
    have changed. Accepting the new versions of these files (if you are
    prompted to choose), then reconfiguring your startup.conf, is the
    safest way to ensure a smooth upgrade.
